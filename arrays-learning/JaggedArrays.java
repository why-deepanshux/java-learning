        // what are jagged arrays 
// In Java, a Jagged array is a multidimensional array where each row can have a different number of columns. When we work with a jagged array, one thing to keep in mind is that the inner array can be of different lengths. It is like a 2D array, but each row can have a different number of elements.
        int nums[][] = new int[2][];
        // this is an example of jagged irregular array;
        nums[0] = new int[3];
        nums[1] = new int[4];
    }
